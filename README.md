Image-Processing-Demo
=====================

An R-based Shiny application demonstrating a few basic image processing analyses on a simple dataset.
- The live version is located at https://4quant.shinyapps.io/MNTDemo/, but has less functionality since several of the packages are not supported on the ShinyApps platform.

- To run this simply install the shiny library and the others listed in the ```packages.R``` file. Then type to get it running on your own machine.

```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("4Quant/Image-Processing-Demo")
```
